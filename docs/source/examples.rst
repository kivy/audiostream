Example to generate a wave form using sin() method, and stream to the speaker::

    from time import sleep
    from audiostream import get_output
    from audiostream.sources.wave import SineSource

    # get a output stream where we can play samples
    stream = get_output(channels=2, rate=22050, buffersize=1024)

    # create one wave sin() at 440Hz, attach it to our speaker, and play
    sinsource = SineSource(stream, 440)
    sinsource.start()

    # you can change the frequency of the source during the playtime
    for x in xrange(10):
        sinsource.frequency = 440 + x
        sleep(.5)

    # ok we are done, stop everything.
    sinsource.stop()

Example to read microphone bytes::

    from audiostream import get_input

    # declare a callback where we'll receive the data
    def callback_mic(data):
        print 'i got', len(data)

    # get the microphone (or from another source if available)
    mic = get_input(callback=callback_mic)
    mic.start()
    sleep(5)
    mic.stop()
